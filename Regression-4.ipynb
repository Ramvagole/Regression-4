    "Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization or L1 penalization, is a regression technique used for feature selection and regularization in \n",

    "\n",
    "The key characteristic of Lasso Regression is that it encourages sparse solutions, meaning it tends to shrink some of the regression coefficients\n",

    "Feature Selection: Lasso Regression performs automatic feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution Path: Lasso Regression typically produces a solution path where the coefficient estimates vary smoothly as the tuning parameter (λ) changes.\n",
